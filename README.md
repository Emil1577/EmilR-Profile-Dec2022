## Setup the HTML 

## Setup the html head and CSS file.

## Setting up the Semantics based on the requirements for this project.

### Setup the header, navigation, main and the footer elements, Created the configurations for each element.  Created a CSS ":root" for the colors and fonts that will be use for this project.  

## Setting up the layout of the page.

### Created the elements for each semantics (header, nav, main, footer) .  I set all elements to have a max-width of 1000px and auto align to center at the CSS file.  

### ".my-header" is the element inside the Header  containing the configuration of the element.  Inside is my profile photo and the text box.  Created a CSS file for this element.

### The main containers has the ".aboutme" and "mywork", Created a CSS file for this element.


## .main element - has two division which are "aboutme" and "mywork".  These elements are set 100% width and which are relative to the main element used the flex and wrap direction row within the container.  

## Created a class container of "section-container" which has "section1" and "mywork",  the CSS for this container is created.  

### Under this container has "section1" which is used a label on the left side acting like a aside.  This has text "About Me" and "My work".   Did this so I can create just one CSS.

## "mywork" element:

### Created five different element.  Which are "surfreport", "ledwall", "calculator", "pastelpuzzle", "runbuddy".  Unfortunately I was not able to update the names of this element to match the images.   

### All elements except "surfreport has the same style in the CSS.  CSS is identified as ".ledwall, .calculator, .runbuddy, .pastelpuzzle".

### ".surfreport" has a different style to I can make the image 100% width of the "mywork" container.

### In summary I divided the each "section-container iin to two elements to separate the "section1" (which has the text "About me" and "My Work".) . I did this so when changing the size of the window it will flex propoerly on both sides.

## Images

### I set a href for each element as a Javascript alert.

### CSS style for all except for the "surfreport is the same.

### created a "text-box" element and style in the CSS.  The text box is relative to the  which is relative the class of each images.  This is to bring the text inside the image and when the images move it goes with the position of the image.

## Scrolls to the webpage when selected.

###  Created and id label before the division of where I want to scroll the page.  Example <div id="aboutme" > .  Under the navigation I created a link example " <a href= "#aboutme" > About me</a>" So when I click this link it scrolls to the page where I placed the <div id="aboutme" > .


## Screen resizing max-width 1016px;

### ".section1 - I change the CSS style to make the lement on top of the "aboutme" and "myWork"

### h1 - change to make the text smaller to fit on the phone.

### surfreport - I change this to retain it's position on top making the height adopts to the screen  size.
